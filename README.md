<p id="description">To claim any Scholarships provided by Government it is a very hectic process of applying verifying and releasing funds manually. This takes upto 15-30 days or sometimes even more. Our project is made for creating transparency in the scholarship program where both the applicant and the officer can check the live status of the application and have the access to various scholarship program on a single platform making it easy for both. The Student must upload their documents which will be verified by our multifactor authentication system including video/photo verification. The technology used is - Vite Tezos Blockchain Lemmebuild</p>
